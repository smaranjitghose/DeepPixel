### Background: 🔍

Deep Neural networks have already surpassed human level performance in tasks such as object recognition and detection. However, deep networks were lagging far behind in tasks like generating artistic artefacts having high perceptual quality until recent times. Creating better quality art using machine learning techniques is imperative for reaching human-like capabilities, as well as opens up a new spectrum of possibilities. And with the advancement of computer hardware as well as the proliferation of deep learning, deep learning is right now being used to create art. For example, an [AI generated art](https://www.christies.com/features/A-collaboration-between-two-artists-one-human-one-a-machine-9332-1.aspx) won’t be sold at an auction for a whopping $432,500.



## Tasks: 📝📋

- Implement different image processing scripts(using opencv)that can used to enhancing pictures,obtaining information and transforming it for desired purposes
- Use deep learning for the same. Eg: Neural Style Transfer,BlackandWhitetoColor
- Reimplement State-of-the-Art(SOTA) Research papers for the this
- **Suggestion**: Use Tranfer Learning
- For the image processing tasks make custom datasets...use tools like CVAT
- Repeat the same for the deep learning tasks
- Convert the work done in Jupyter Notebooks into executable scripts
- Use TensorFlow.JS to build end to end models for showcase
- Build a website for this project
- Extend the work for some of the sripts to make a Flutter app using TensorFlow Lite
- Improve the documentation (ReadME)

## Guidelines to Contribute : 🤚 🏗

- **Don't push** anything to the root directory.Always use specific subdirectories inside the [deeppixel](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/DeepPixel/tree/master/deeppixel) directory 

For each of the tasks:

- Experiment building this using a Jupyter notebook locally or on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Build a script for the task inside the ```respective ``` directory
- Inside the ```bw_to_c``` directory, create two folders ```input``` and ```output``` to be used for the input and output images
- Use [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) library so that the input image and output path can be given as arguments in the terminal while running the script
-  Create a ```requirements.txt``` file and specify the modules used
- Try your script/notebook with multiple images and store the results in output folder
- Comment your script/notebook well
- Create/Update the ReadME.MD file:
    - Name of the task
    - A small description
    - Approach used
    - Input and Output Images
- Make sure you have the model weight or any related files like haarcascades to run the script in the same direcorty
- Give a Pull Request
- In your PR, please try to give a link to a Colab Notebook(if applicable) as a comment.
- In your PR, put a reference to the issue it is for
- once your model/script works, curate your own dataset and get the outputs..(Try 10 images) adn give a second PR about your own Dataset
- Try out other methods to implement the above

__Please do not use a code from someone else's repo or a blog like PyImageSearch directly..You can definitely refer to others' code. But make sure you have some contributions of your own into it. If you strongly use a code from someone else,please credit them properly in the README file of the respective directory.
