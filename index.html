						Deep Neural networks have already surpassed human level performance in tasks such as object
						recognition and detection. However, deep networks were lagging far behind in tasks like generating
						artistic artefacts having high perceptual quality until recent times. Creating better quality art
						using machine learning techniques is imperative for reaching human-like capabilities, as well as
						opens up a new spectrum of possibilities. And with the advancement of computer hardware as well as
						the proliferation of deep learning, deep learning is right now being used to create art. For
						example, an AI generated art won’t be sold at an auction for a whopping $432,500.

						Deep pixels implement different image processing scripts(using opencv) that can used to enhancing
						pictures,obtaining information and transforming it for desired purposes. It uses deep learning like
						Neural Style Transfer,Black and White to Color image transformation for the same.

					<h3>1. Face Recognition</h3>

					<ul>
						<li>
							The task is to input an image and output the image with faces detected (boundary boxes are
							drawn)
						</li>
						<li>Count the number of faces detected</li>
						<li>Real-Time Face Detection</li>
						<li>
							A pre-trained model(like MobileNet) that takes in a custom dataset of faces and recognizes the
							faces with labels in other images
						</li>
						<li>Get the gender and age</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>2. Real Time Pose Detection</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The function should access a webcam or feed any video and estimate the position of a person
							based upon their key joint positions
						</li>
