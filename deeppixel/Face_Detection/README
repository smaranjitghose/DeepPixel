**AIM:** 
To detect faces in the input images and saving output images

**INPUT :**  Any image having faces in it .
**OUTPUT :** Images with rectangles on detected faces.
**Requirement :**
         OpenCV already contains many pre-trained classifiers for face, eyes, smile etc. We will be using Face classifier for 
         face detection . we need to load the required XML classifiers for detection.

**Process :**
1) Import all the required libraries
2) Convert the input image into gray scale as haarcascade classifier accepts grayscale images
3) import haarcascade classifier
4) Now we find the faces in the image. If faces are found, it returns the positions of detected faces as Rect(x,y,w,h). 
5)Once we get these locations,  create a rectangle or anyshape for the face
6) Save the output image
